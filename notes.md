This file describes how I want my gem to act.

1. greeting - something like: Welcome to Techmeme_Reader would you like to see a list of todays stories? y/n or type exit to leave.
2. maybe if no is entered then ask if user wants to go directly to the website of exit.
3. when yes, scrape website and list all top stories for that day.
4. then ask what story they would like to see.

classes I will need:

CLI
scraper
Reader
